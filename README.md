## How to use
first download models and save them in same directory with IPYNB file as jupyter notebooks then Run nootbooks.

### Model weights
Kaggle Drive Link:().

### Training and Testing
1) Download the face mask detection dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/covid-segmentation).
2) 2) Run the following code to install the Requirements.

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3) Run the below code to train the Unet++ with ELU activision as Decoder and... as Encoder with this dataset.
4) 
Unet++ with ELU activision as Decoder and MobileNet V3 mobile as  Encoder
Unet++ with ELU activision as Decoder and NasNet mobile as  Encoder
Unet++ with ELU activision as Decoder and EfficientNetB0 as  Encoder

6) Test trained model with this dataset in in IPYNB too.
